    <h1>Closures</h1>
    <script type="text/javascript">

        // JavaScript is a "garbage collected" language.
        // this means that values stored in memory are regularlly visited to 
        // determine if they are no longer needed. if so, they are removed.
        let testVariable = "hello, world";
        testVariable = undefined; // the string "hello, world" is no longer being pointed to, and will be removed from the heap at some point in the future


        // in JavaScript, this means that as long as a value has an active pointer it will be retained
        
        // now consider the following code:
        function testFunction1() {
            let i = 0;
            console.log(i)
        }

        // if we call this function we will create the variable i, which is scoped to the most recently opened block (the function)
        // once the function completes there is no way to access this variable anymore (the function has ended)
        // so JavaScript will remove it


        // however, consider this situation:
        function testFunction2() {
            let i = 0;
            document.querySelector('h1').onclick = function() {
                console.log(i);
            }
        }

        // in this case we have set up an event listener inside of the function. this event listener is referencing the
        // local variable 'i', which is scoped to the testFunction2 block. because there is still a way for the program
        // to access the variable it is retained. this is what we refer to as a "closure" 

        // definition:
        // A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures
        


        // as you can see from the example above, functions in JavaScript can be 'nested' -- for example, the 'inside' function is nested inside of the 'fun2' function
        // it is a 'local' function to fun2 - the only way to call it invoke it from inside of the 'fun2' function
        function fun2() {

            function inside() {
                console.log("inside was called!");
            }

            inside();
        }

        fun2();


        // nested functions have access to their own variable scope as well as their parent's variable scope.  For example:
        function fun3() {
            let counter = 0;
            function countUp() {
                console.log("Counter started at: ", counter);
                counter += 1; // update the 'counter' variable that is local to our parent's variable scope
                console.log("Counter is now: ", counter);
            }

            countUp();
        }



        // when a function executes JavaScript carves out a little piece of memory to hold the function and all of its variables -
        // but if a function has another function inside of it things can get a little strange.  as long as there is a reference
        // to this region of memory JavaScript will not remove the local variables associated with the function.
        // this region of persistant memory is called a 'closure'
        function fun4() {
            let counter = 0;
            function countUp() {
                counter += 1;
                console.log("Counter is now: ", counter);
            }

            // return a REFERENCE to the local function 'countUp'
            return countUp;
        }

        // 'a' is a link to the countUp function inside of fun3
        let a = fun4();

        // calling 'a' will invoke the countUp function, which manipulates the local variable 'a' inside of fun3
        a();
        // note how the counter variable keeps going up!  this is because the closure is holding onto every local value inside
        // of the function and will not allow it to go away since there is a link to the closure here in the main program
        a();
        a();
        a();

        console.log("-----");

        // if we invoke the function a second time a new closure is formed.  this closure is independent of the one created above,
        // so the local variable can change and have a different value from the previous closure.
        let b = fun4();
        b();
        b();

        console.log("-----");

        // note how 'a' was unaffected by what we did to 'b'
        a();
        b();



        // so why does all of this matter?
        // well, we know that we can tamper with global variables using the JavaScript console
        // we also know that we cannot tamper with local variables inside of a function using the JavaScript console
        // if we were to wrap all of our code inside of a function all aspects of our program would become local variables
        // because there are linkages to our program once the function stops running (i.e. event listeners or other functions)
        // a 'closure' is established which retains all local values for us to continue to work with
