    <h1>Function Argument Mechanics</h1>

    <script>

      // a function in JavaScript can be designed to accept 0 or more arguments
      function fun1(a) {
        console.log(a);
      }
      fun1(5);  // 5

      // however, there is no explicit rule that prevents you from sending
      // more or less arguments to a JavaScript function.  For example:
      fun1(); // undefined, but the program doesn't crash

      // likewise, you can create a function that is designed to accept no arguments
      function fun2() {
        console.log("fun 2 was called");
      }

      // and you can send this function an argument without the program crashing
      fun2(5);  // fun 2 was called
